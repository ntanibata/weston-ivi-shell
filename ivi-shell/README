- Extension protocal; ivi-application to tie wl_surface and a given ID.
  With this ID, shell can identify which wl_surface is drawn by which
  application. In in-vehicle infortainment system, a shell has to update
  a property of a wl_surface. E.g. there may be a use case when vehicle
  starts to move, the wl_surface drawn by Car navigation is expected to
  move top of surfaces.
